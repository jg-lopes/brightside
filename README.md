# brightside

Small static website for Brightside Consultoria Social (Social Consulting), a startup proposal made at the headquarters of Startup Rio, one of Rio de Janeiros biggest accelerators. 

The link to the website was given using small QR codes handouts for each participant in the presentation. As such, it was meant to be a quick and succint landing page for those interested in the presentation, allowing for quick identification and contact information.

The website can be accessed at https://jg-lopes.github.io/brightside
